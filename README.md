# Restaurant Application
This is the first React project I was part of.

Web application that allows the user to manage inventory, user permissions, clients,
billing, purchasing, employees, and providers.

If the user has the necessary permissions such as the admin role, then is allowed to register 
and view bills, purchases, employees, clients, providers, products, add and remove permissions 
to other users, also, the admin role is allowed to accept or decline products from any 
provider, the application automatically creates records for following information:

- Employee positions
- Employee salaries
- Taxes
- Product prices

The application creates logs every time there is a request from the Front-End to the Back-End,
you can see the Back-End repository in the link below:
